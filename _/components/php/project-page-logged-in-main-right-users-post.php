	<div class="thumbnail project-page-logged-in-main-right-user-post-thumbnail">	Wall where users post news/comments/etc. Maybe things posted by an admin should be marked with a specific color and maybe unread wal-posts also should have a specific color (so that you see when something is new). Maybe the admin should be able to star posts, so that these posts are permanently placed on top.  </div>
